<p>Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</p>
</div>
	
<div class="principles">
<div class="set_1"><br>
<p><strong>1. Good design is innovative</strong><br>
Without innovative design, we would see the same things over and over again. While I don't think that designers need to contantly be reinventing the wheel, it is important to keep up with innovation in technology.</p>
	
<p><strong>2. Good design makes a product useful</strong><br>
I agree that when designing a product one of the main goals should be its usefulness. When designing I keep the viewer/user in mind to remember how this will be useful to them.</p>
	
<p><strong>3. Good design is aesthetic</strong><br>
While the functionality of a product is most important, it takes a pleasing aesthetic for a user to desire it compared to a less pretty design. I try to at least execute my designs well; whether someone is a fan of the style or not is up to them.</p>
	
<p><strong>4. Good design makes a product understandable</strong><br>
I agree that designs that are easy to understand are some of the best. I would rather have a design be oversimplified than overcomplicated.</p>
	
<p><strong>5. Good design is unobtrusive</strong><br>
I agree that the design of a product should be unobtrusive to its purpose, but I also think that it's nice to have products that are pleasing to look at even if they aren't meant to be works of art.</p>
</div>
	<br>
<div class="set_2">
<p><strong>6. Good design is honest</strong><br>
I agree that a well-designed product should not trick the consumer into thinking that can do any more than it actually can, or is better than it actually is.</p>
	
<p><strong>7. Good design is long-lasting</strong><br>
It is important for a design to be long-lasting so that no matter how much time has passed it won't seem outdated.</p>
	
<p><strong>8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</strong><br>
Mistakes happen but I agree that design should come from well-thought-out decisions.</p>
	
<p><strong>9. Good design is environmentally-friendly</strong><br>
Being environmentally-friendly is definitely something I try to keep in mind when designing. Wasting paper is something that I actively have to try to avoid.</p>
	
<p><strong>10. Good design is as little design as possible</strong><br>
I agree because often times putting too much thought into a design can ruin it by adding unnecessary things. When I design I try to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
