<h1>dieter rams<br>
	10 principles for<br>
	good design</h1>
</div>


	
<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>1</h2>	
</div>
<p><strong>good design is innovative</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Without innovative design, we would see the same things over and over again. While I don't think that designers need to constantly be reinventing the wheel, it is important to keep up with innovation in technology.</p>
</div>
	

	
<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>2</h2>	
</div>
<p><strong>good design makes a product useful</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>I agree that when designing a product one of the main goals should be its usefulness. When designing I keep the viewer/user in mind to remember how this will be useful to them. </p>
</div>
	

	
<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>3</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design is aesthetic</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>While the functionality of a product is most important, it takes a pleasing aesthetic for a user to desire it compared to a less "pretty" design. I try to at least execute my designs well; whether someone is a fan of the style or not is up to them. </p>
</div>

	

<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>4</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design makes a product understandable</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>I agree that designs that are easy to understand are some of the best. I would rather have a design be oversimplified than overcomplicated.</p>
</div>
	


<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>5</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design is unobtrusive</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>I agree that the design of a product should be unobtrusive to its purpose, but I also think that it's nice to have products that are pleasing to look at even if they aren't meant to be works of art.</p>
</div>
	

	
<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>6</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design is honest</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I agree that a well-designed product should not trick the consumer into thinking that can do any more than it actually can, or is better than it actually is.</p>
</div>
	

	
<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>7</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design is long-lasting</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>It is important for a design to be long-lasting so that no matter how much time has passed it won't seem outdated.</p>
</div>
	

	
<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>8</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design is thorough down to the last detail</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>Mistakes happen but I agree that design should come from well-thought-out decisions.</p>
</div>
	

	
<div class="main">
<div class="number">
<h2>9</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design is environmentally-friendly</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>Being environmentally-friendly is definitely something I try to keep in mind when designing. Wasting paper is something that I actively have to try to avoid.</p>
</div>
	

	
<div class="ten">
<div class="number">
<h2>10</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>good design is as little design as possible</strong></p>	
<hr>
<p>I agree because often times putting too much thought into a design can ruin it by adding unnecessary things. When I design I try to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
</div>
